* #### What are the assumpations mad in Linear Regression?

There are mainly 4 types of assumpation made in Linear regression:
1. Relationship between dependend and independent variables should be a linear.
2. The independent variable should not be co related. ie. multicollinearity.
3. The error terms (Residuals) must have constant variance. This is know as Homoscadasticity.
4. The error term (Residual) must be normally distributed.
